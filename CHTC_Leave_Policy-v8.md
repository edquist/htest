# CHTC Leave Policy and Procedures [last update 11/5/14]

## Rationale: Why are we establishing these guidelines?

- We've had issues with the CHTC 'shutting down' in the summer,
  especially June.
- We've had skills shortages that have impacted schedules, our ability
  to respond to urgent issues and our ability to provide timely customer
  service.
- The Computer Sciences department will not enter leave information
  without supervisor signature.

## Leave Request Procedure

#### _Staff Responsibilities:_

- Planned leave must first be approved by your supervisor in advance in
  accordance with UW and CHTC policy (see below).
  Supervisors should respond promptly to vacation requests.
  If they do not, remind them early and often!
- Absences of more than two hours require
  i) an email to htcondor-schedule@cs.wisc.edu, and
  ii) an entry in your schedule file.
  If you are sick, email and update your schedule file as early as
  you physically can that day, preferably before noon.
  In either case, promptly updating your schedule file (retaining entries
  from previous months) is important because it enables
  i) monitoring staff coverage in each functional area,
  ii) proactively notifying supervisors and co-workers of absences via daily
  email and a web-based calendar,
  iii) computing the percentage of monthly vacation use across the center, and
  iv) tracking effort on different Center activities.
  Supervisors will sign leave reports only after confirming that leave report
  entries match actual absences and also match your schedule file,
  and that planned leave was approved in advance.
  Failure to follow keep your schedule file up to date could delay supervisor
  approval of your leave form, and thus result in forfeiture of sick leave.
- Each month, turn in your completed and signed yellow leave report
  to your designated supervisor by the 5th day (or next business day if the
  5th is not).
  Late leave reports may not be signed or entered until the following month.
- If there are conflicts in leave requests, staff should work together
  to find mutually agreeable solutions such as shifting vacations,
  swapping vacation time, and training backup coverage.
- Complete major tasks before taking leave, if possible; the longer the
  absence, the more critical this point becomes.
  If it is not possible to complete major tasks before a planned absence,
  work with your supervisor(s) and teammates to identify a backup who will
  be responsible for the task during your absence.
- If you have other issues with the way your leave is managed by your
  supervisor, talk to the CHTC Director whom is ultimately responsible
  for staff issues.

#### _Supervisors Responsibilities:_

- Supervisors will sign leave reports that are submitted on time and
  turn them into the department no later than the 10th of the month.
  Supervisors who are absent at the start of the month must make
  arrangements to have leave reports submitted to the department on time.
- Supervisors will not sign a leave report that does not match the
  corresponding schedule file and leave email(s).
- Supervisors will respond promptly to leave requests on a first-come,
  first-serve basis.
- Supervisors will approve leave requests liberally when we are meeting
  our target goals (above), but will likely deny leave requests when we
  do not meet those goals.
- Supervisors will assist staff whose leave requests are denied by
  encouraging vacation swaps, finding alternate times,or recommending
  rollover (see below).
- Challenging vacation requests may require discussion with the Director.
- Supervisors/Directors may approve leave exceptions outside of these
  guidelines as needed.

## Sick Leave Policy

The CHTC sick leave policy follows that of the University.
Full details are at http://www.uwsa.edu/ohrwd/benefits/leave/sick/.
The synopsis is you may use sick leave when you miss work due to the
following:
(a) a medical, dental, vision appointment for you or a family member,
(b) your own illness or injury,
(c) for temporary care of a family member with an illness or injury, or
(d) after the death of a family member.
The federal or Wisconsin Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) may allow
use of sick leave for purposes other than those listed above.
If you miss work due to illness for 5 or more consecutive days, you must
provide written physician certification (does not apply if on approved
FMLA leave).

## Vacation Leave Policy

CHTC vacation leave policy follows that of the University.
However, the University states that Vacation Leave requires
supervisor/unit approval.
The following guidelines determine when a CHTC supervisor will approve
or disapprove a vacation leave request:

1.  Non-emergency vacations must be requested and approved in advance.
    Emergencies (such as child care coverage, water leak, broken car,
    etc.) are the rare exception.
    In general, the longer the vacation period, the more advance notice
    should be given.
    Specifically, the guidelines are:
    * a.  Leave of less than a week should be approved a week in advance.
    * b.  Leave of a week or more should be approved at least a month in
          advance.
    * c.  Leave over two weeks in a four-week period should be approved
          three months in advance.
    * d.  Other leave-based schedule modifications, like taking every
          Friday off for a month, working half days for a couple of weeks etc.
          should be approved a month in advance.
2.  To prevent the CHTC from becoming a ghost town during certain times
    of the year, no more than 16% of the CHTC’s total vacation days should
    be taken in any one month.
    There are a few times during the year when our society at large does
    not expect most people to be working (especially the days surrounding
    Thanksgiving and the last two weeks of the calendar year) and we will
    not hold ourselves to this policy during those times.
3.  Whenever someone is gone, their critical skills should be coverable
    by someone else who is not on vacation.
4.  Staff may roll over up to 80 hours of unused vacation time from the
    previous fiscal year into the next fiscal year.
    Rolling over more than 80 hours requires approval by the CHTC Director
    (see below).

While there may be occasional days that do not meet these goals, they
should be the _rare exception_.
The guidelines in this section are only for discretionary leave and do not
apply to religious holidays, death in family, jury duty or sick leave.

A major reason for the historic spike in vacation in June is due to
staff not using their vacation before the “use it or lose it date” of
June 30th.
Because using vacation in June may impact the ability of your co-workers to
take off time in June, please try to avoid a vacation end-of-year stockpile.
However, we understand the best laid plans do not always work out, or a
unique opportunity/event may only occur in June.
Therefore, to assist people to spread out their vacation, the Director
may grant reasonable requests to rollover vacation for up to four months
(through October).
When staff find themselves with excess vacation despite efforts to avoid
this situation, they may be unable to take all of it in June and therefore
they should consider a rollover request.
